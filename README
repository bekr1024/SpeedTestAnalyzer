Notes for Raspberry Pi usage:

======================= BEFORE RUNNING SPEEDTEST PROGRAM =======================

Run the following commands in terminal:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade

  sudo apt-get install python3-pip
  sudo pip3 install speedtest-cli


Next, test speedtest by running the command:

  speedtest-cli


This should give internet speed data. If not, check that the previous commands
were executed successfully.

================================================================================

==================== CHANGING CRONTAB TO AUTOMATE PROGRAM ======================

Run the following command in the Raspberry Pi terminal:

  crontab -e

It may have you select an editor. Select your editor of choice. ( I prefer nano)
Once in the crontab file, go to the very bottom and write the following lines
verbatim.

*/15 * * * * python3 /home/pi/Desktop/SpeedTestAnalyzer/SpeedTest.py
2 0 * * * python3 /home/pi/Desktop/SpeedTestAnalyzer/plot_test.py $(date -d "yesterday 13:00" +%Y-%m-%d)


The first line gives a speedtest every 15 minutes, the second line
produces and saves a .png image file for the previous day's plot at 12:02 am
every day. You may edit these schedules at your own discretion.
